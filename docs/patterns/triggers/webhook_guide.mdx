When you use Composio you can receive two kinds of events:
1. Trigger Events
2. Admin Events

Receiving webhook events is particularly useful for listening to events such as when an Email is received on your Gmail, when you receive a Slack Message, or when a new Connection is created.

<Steps>
    <Step title='Create an Event Destination'>
    You need to create an event destination to receive events at an HTTPS webhook endpoint. After you register a webhook endpoint, Composio can push event data to your applicationâ€™s webhook endpoint when events happen.
    To see how it works, you can create an event destination on Pipedream.
    1. Access Pipedream:
    - Log in to your Pipedream account or create a new one if you don't have one.
    2. Create a New Workflow:
    - Navigate to the "Projects" section in Pipedream.
    - Click "Create New Workflow" at the top right.
    - Give your workflow a descriptive name (e.g., "New Customer Signup Webhook").
    3. Add the HTTP/Webhook Trigger:
    - In the workflow builder, click on the "Add Trigger" option.
    - Select "HTTP/Webhook" as the trigger type.
    - This will generate a unique URL that you'll need to paste into your external application's webhook settings.
    </Step>

    <Step title='Configuring Composio'>
    1. Go to the [Events and Triggers Section](https://app.composio.dev/events_and_triggers) in the Composio Dashboard.
    2. Paste the URL generated in the previous step into the 'Trigger Webhook URL' and 'Admin Event Webhook URL' and click 'Update'.
    </Step>

    <Step title='Viewing Received Events'>
    You can view the Received Events in your Pipedream workflow page.

    Here's what a sample Event looks like: 
    <CodeGroup>
    ```shell Trigger Event
    {
        body: {
            threadId: "19304057f434b32a"
            messageId: "19304057f434b32a"
            messageTimestamp: "2024-11-07T00:15:55Z"
            messageText: "View this post on the web at https://read.substack.com/ In a twist, what..."
            attachmentList: [...]
            subject: "The U.S. economy ..."
            sender: "Substack Reads <read@substack.com>"
            to: "demo@gmail.com"
            payload: {...}
        }
    }
    ```

    ```shell Admin Event
    {
    "body": {
        "type": "connected_account.add.completed",
        "timestamp": "2024-11-07T08:49:21.820Z",
        "data": {
        "app_name": "gmail",
        "integration_id": "12345678-abcd-ef00-1234-56789abcdef0",
        "body": {
            "access_token": "ya29",
            "expires_in": 3599,
            "refresh_token": "1//05kmszkwK0ZmhCgYIARAAGAUSNwF",
            "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "connected_account_id": "abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd",
            "status": "success"
        }
        }
    }
    }
    ```
